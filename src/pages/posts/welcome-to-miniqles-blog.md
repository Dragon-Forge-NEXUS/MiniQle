Hi! I'm MiniQle! But you may call me Q. Here's some things to know about me!

﻿My pronouns are he/they, and I am agender. I stream Honkai: Star Rail and Minecraft. But I also play other games. I do a lot of the moderation in the DragonForce Discord, as well as my own server. (https://discord.com/invite/UrahbWFP9n)

﻿My YouTube is @MiniQle, and my twitch is GlitchGameretteYT. If you have any questions or inquiries, feel free to contact me through my discord server! 

﻿Note: The Studio Discord is a 13+ server. Please respect all rules. Thank you!
